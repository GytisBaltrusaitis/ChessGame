# About the project

When you install this project and run it, you will be able to play a chess game offline.
It could be used playing with a friend on the same PC or for trying new variations ant strategies.

It can move pieces accordingly, track pieces positions, avoid running into check, switch sides for players,
and game ends when opponent king is checkmated, it does not have a draw or stalemate, so you will probably need to
